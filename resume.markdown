## Summary

My most recent role was as a Senior Software Engineer at Vacasa where I worked on the Finance Technology
team.

What I loved about this role was that it really fulfilled my curiosity to know how everything worked first hand: from
the infra on up to the business logic and database management.

I love reading and writing code and have experience planning and building greenfield products and features as
well as maintaining legacy products. I love taking a TDD approach and one of the first questions I will always ask
myself is “How do we test this?”.

And it’s not just the tech that made me excited for this role: I also loved engaging with my team. I thrive on
collaboration and deep diving into topics. I encourage “stupid” questions (and ask them myself) and lean into my
teammates to ensure everyone has a voice at the table and we have the same understanding.

I love figuring out the business needs, making a plan and then bringing my ideas to the team in the form of a
conversation, a presentation, or ADR. I have experience advocating for my ideas and documenting proposals and
decisions.

When writing tickets (Epics, Stories, etc) for my team, I learned first hand how important it can be to differentiate
between the acceptance criteria and the implementation criteria: leaving enough room for developers to form their
own opinions and use their own creativity but with enough guidance to reach the same end goal.

My previous (pre-tech) work experience was in the specialty coffee industry where I was the General Manger of
a busy cafe. That experience plays a huge role in how I operate: putting the team first; looking at the big picture;
pushing product out the door in a collaborative, positive, way; lifting people up when they are bogged down;
always offering to help or offer a listening ear; and of course keeping my eye on the prize of executing a great
product in a timely manner, to keep our customers coming back for more.

My hobbies include working on my truck, hiking, camping, talking about Star Trek, spending time with my family
and drinking coffee.
